abstract = {To foster collaboration and knowledge transfer between the fields of bibliometrics / scientometrics / informetrics on the one hand and information retrieval on the other hand, we successfully ran a workshop series on bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (BIR). This workshop report presents the BIR 2016 workshop, which has been co-located with ECIR for the third time this year. We motivate our workshop and outline the papers (one keynote and seven regular papers) presented at ECIR 2016 in Padua, Italy. Finally we reflect on past BIR workshops and conclude with an outlook of future directions.},

@article{Cabanac,
abstract = {The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in information seeking and sensemaking. Bibliometric, information retrieval (IR), text mining, and NLP techniques could help in these activities, but are not yet widely used in digital libraries. The BIRNDL workshop was held at the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2016) in Newark, NJ. It intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometric, and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The workshop incorporated three paper sessions and the 2nd edition of the CL-SciSumm Shared Task.},

abstract = {This panel brings together experts in bibliometrics and information retrieval to discuss how each of these two important areas of information science can help to inform the research of the other. There is a growing body of literature that capitalizes on the synergies created by combining methodological approaches of each to solve research problems and practical issues related to how information is created, stored, organized, retrieved and used. The session will begin with an overview of the common threads that exist between IR and metrics, followed by a summary of findings from the BIR workshops and examples of research projects that combine aspects of each area to benefit IR or metrics research areas, including search results ranking, semantic indexing and visualization. The panel will conclude with an engaging discussion with the audience to identify future areas of research and collaboration.},
