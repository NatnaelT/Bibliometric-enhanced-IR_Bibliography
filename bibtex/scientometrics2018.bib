title="Use of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to match Web of Science and Scopus",

abstract="A novel hashing algorithm is applied to match two prominent and important bibliographic databases at the paper level. In the literature, such tasks have been studied and conducted many times, but relying only on journal information due to massive volume of indexed publications. As a result of paper based match, missing or erroneous items can be completed from other source or the overlap can be measured more reliably. In this context, we focus on measuring the overlap between Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus at the paper level. Our focus is on detecting exact matches, that is, no false positives are tolerated at all. To this end, we follow a twofold matching procedure. First, a locality sensitive hashing algorithm is applied, which provides fast approximate nearest neighbours and similarities, in order to obtain WoS-Scopus pair suggestions. Second, for each suggested pair, different heuristics are applied to identify those pair of records that indeed refer to the same publication. We observe that at least 74{\%} of WoS publications are also indexed by Scopus. The percentage increases to 92{\%} when only the cited publications are retained. The overlapped WoS records are also presented based on Institute for Scientific Information subject categories (SC). Of those, three big SCs, whose overlap ratios are relatively low, are chosen and examined in detail. Last but not the least, it takes just about an hour to match 14.2 million versus 19.6 million publications from a publication year range of 2004--2013 in a high performance computer environment.",

title="Authorship identification of documents with high content similarity",

abstract="The goal of our work is inspired by the task of associating segments of text to their real authors. In this work, we focus on analyzing the way humans judge different writing styles. This analysis can help to better understand this process and to thus simulate/ mimic such behavior accordingly. Unlike the majority of the work done in this field (i.e. authorship attribution, plagiarism detection, etc.) which uses content features, we focus only on the stylometric, i.e. content-agnostic, characteristics of authors. Therefore, we conducted two pilot studies to determine, if humans can identify authorship among documents with high content similarity. The first was a quantitative experiment involving crowd-sourcing, while the second was a qualitative one executed by the authors of this paper. Both studies confirmed that this task is quite challenging. To gain a better understanding of how humans tackle such a problem, we conducted an exploratory data analysis on the results of the studies. In the first experiment, we compared the decisions against content features and stylometric features. While in the second, the evaluators described the process and the features on which their judgment was based. The findings of our detailed analysis could (1) help to improve algorithms such as automatic authorship attribution as well as plagiarism detection, (2) assist forensic experts or linguists to create profiles of writers, (3) support intelligence applications to analyze aggressive and threatening messages and (4) help editor conformity by adhering to, for instance, journal specific writing style.",

abstract="Research is often described as a problem-solving activity, and as a result, descriptions of problems and solutions are an essential part of the scientific discourse used to describe research activity. We present an automatic classifier that, given a phrase that may or may not be a description of a scientific problem or a solution, makes a binary decision about problemhood and solutionhood of that phrase. We recast the problem as a supervised machine learning problem, define a set of 15 features correlated with the target categories and use several machine learning algorithms on this task. We also create our own corpus of 2000 positive and negative examples of problems and solutions. We find that we can distinguish problems from non-problems with an accuracy of 82.3{\%}, and solutions from non-solutions with an accuracy of 79.7{\%}. Our three most helpful features for the task are syntactic information (POS tags), document and word embeddings.",

title="Discovering cross-topic collaborations among researchers by exploiting weighted association rules",
journal="Scientometrics",

month="Apr",

abstract="Identifying the most relevant scientific publications on a given topic is a well-known research problem. The Author-Topic Model (ATM) is a generative model that represents the relationships between research topics and publication authors. It allows us to identify the most influential authors on a particular topic. However, since most research works are co-authored by many researchers the information provided by ATM can be complemented by the study of the most fruitful collaborations among multiple authors. This paper addresses the discovery of research collaborations among multiple authors on single or multiple topics. Specifically, it exploits an exploratory data mining technique, i.e., weighted association rule mining, to analyze publication data and to discover correlations between ATM topics and combinations of authors. The mined rules characterize groups of researchers with fairly high scientific productivity by indicating (1) the research topics covered by their most cited publications and the relevance of their scientific production separately for each topic, (2) the nature of the collaboration (topic-specific or cross-topic), (3) the name of the external authors who have (occasionally) collaborated with the group either on a specific topic or on multiple topics, and (4) the underlying correlations between the addressed topics. The applicability of the proposed approach was validated on real data acquired from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man catalog of genetic disorders and from the PubMed digital library. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

title="Automatic identification of cited text spans: a multi-classifier approach over imbalanced dataset",
journal="Scientometrics",
year="2018",
month="Apr",
day="27",
abstract="Recently, a new form of structured summary on scientific papers is explored by grouping cited text spans from the reference paper. Its primary goal is to generate summaries based on the cited paper itself. Previously, traditional scientific summarization focused on citation-based methods by aggregating all citances that cite one unique paper without doing content-based citation analysis, while sometimes citations might differ between researchers or time slots. By investigating original text spans where scholars cited, the new method can reflect exact contributions of reference papers more. Therefore, how to identify cited text spans accurately becomes the first important problem to solve. Generally, it can be converted into finding the sentences in reference paper that is more similar with citation sentences. Taking it as a classification task, we investigate the potential of four actions to improve identification performance. Firstly, feature selections are conducted carefully according to multi-classifiers. Secondly, we apply sampling-based algorithms to preprocess class-imbalanced datasets. Since we integrated results via a weighted voting system, the third action is tuning parameters like, voting weights for multi-classifiers integration or running settings to see if we can improve performance further. Evaluation results show effectiveness of each action and demonstrate that researchers can take these actions for more accurate cited text spans identification when doing scientific summarization.",

abstract="Automatically generated papers have been used to manipulate bibliography indexes on numerous occasions. This paper is interested in different means to generate texts such as recurrent neural network, Markov model, or probabilistic context free grammar, and if it is possible to detect them using a current approach. Then, probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) is focused on as the one most used. However, even though there have been multiple approaches to detect such types of paper, they are all working at the document level and are unable to detect a small amount of generated text inside a larger body of genuinely written text. Thus, we present the grammatical structure similarity measurement to detect sentences or short fragments of automatically generated text from known PCFG generators. The proposed approach is tested against a pattern checker and various common machine learning methods. Additionally, the ability to detect a modified PCFG generator is also tested.",

title="Analysis of search stratagem utilisation",
journal="Scientometrics",

abstract="In interactive information retrieval, researchers consider the user behaviour towards systems and search tasks in order to adapt search results and to improve the search experience of users. Analysing the users' past interactions with the system is one typical approach. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour in retrieval sessions towards Marcia Bates' search stratagems such as ``Footnote Chasing'', ``Citation Searching'', ``Keyword Searching'', ``Author Searching'' and ``Journal Run'' in a real-life academic search engine. In fact, search stratagems represent high-level search behaviour as the users go beyond simple execution of queries and investigate more of the system functionalities. We performed analyses of these five search stratagems using two datasets extracted from the social sciences search engine sowiport. A specific focus was the detection of the search phase and frequency of the usage of these stratagems. In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search process performance. We addressed mainly the usage patterns' observation of the stratagems, their impact on the conduct of retrieval sessions and explored whether they are used similarly in both datasets. From the observation and metrics proposed, we can conclude that the utilisation of search stratagems in real retrieval sessions leads to an improvement of the precision in terms of positive interactions. For both datasets (SUSS 14--15 and SUSS 16--17), the user behaviour was similar as all stratagems appear most frequently in the middle of a session. However, the difference is that ``Footnote Chasing'', ``Citation Searching'' and ``Journal Run'' appear mostly at the end of a session while Keyword and Author Searching appear typically at the beginning. Thus, we can conclude from the log analysis that the improvement of search functionalities including personalisation and/or recommendation could be achieved by considering references, citations, and journals in the ranking process.",
